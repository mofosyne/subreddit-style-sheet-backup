 Besides GIFs and clips also interactive flash or HTML5 art is welcome.

3. **Include the name of the anime in the title.**

 If your post shows characters from a particular anime, include its name within [brackets] in the title of the post. If the characters are not from an established use [Original].

4. **Post the source in the comments.**
