        Links in Sorcery Of The Spectacle requires a small description, at least 100 words explaining how this relates to this subreddit. Note, any post to this comment will be automatically collapsed.

        As a reminder, this is our subreddit description:
        > [We exist in a culture of narrative and media that increasingly, willfully combines agency-robbing fantasy mythos with instantaneous technological disseminationâ€”a self-mutating proteum of semantics: *the spectacle*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3dm0sp?context=10000 "We live in a culture that uses media to tell us how to live. Our culture purposefully creates fantasies that rob us of our freedom, and this is more effective with technology like the internet. This phenomenon is a self modifying cluster of symbols and signs that constantly change their meaning.
